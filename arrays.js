// An array is used when we want to store multiple values in one variable
let planets= ['Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mercury', 'Uranus', 'Saturn']

// You can change the data types but you usually won't just to keep the code clean
// To find out how many values are in the array we would do the variable.length
console.log(planets.length)
